Since there are some problems with my Nvidia I explore the touchDesigner with my classmate together.
First we add some effect on the video input itself, making some mosaic and lag to the output, and create
a kinda downsample effect, which is cool.
Then we explore something about the audio input, and create a sphere that will react and twist with the audio input.
Further attempt would be letting the audio input affect video output, but we haven't got there yet.
